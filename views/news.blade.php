<p>A dinner between Boris Johnson and EU chief Ursula von der Leyen aimed at breaking the Brexit trade talks deadlock has ended without agreement.

    A senior No 10 source said "very large gaps remain between the two sides" but talks will resume.

    The source said "a firm decision should be taken about the future of the talks" by Sunday.

    The meeting, also attended by negotiators Michel Barnier and Lord Frost, lasted about three hours.</p>
